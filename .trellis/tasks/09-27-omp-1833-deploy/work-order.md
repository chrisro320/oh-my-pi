# Upgrade implementation work order

Active task: .trellis/tasks/09-27-omp-1833-deploy

Read PRD/design/implement and patch-rollup/verification specs. User approved minimal 18.3.3 candidate adaptation and deployment. Own assigned candidate IDs only; no old patch edits, no live writes, no commit. Skip formatting, linting, builds and tests during parallel work. Main owns integration and shared gates. Use private pristine trees. Never claim evidence not executed. Audit required strings with built-in grep at delivery and review: Pristine input MUST; Full-chain verification MUST; Gate loading MUST fail closed.

# Trellis Instructions

These instructions are for AI assistants working in this project.

This project is managed by Trellis. The working knowledge you need lives under `.trellis/`:

- `.trellis/workflow.md` — development phases, when to create tasks, skill routing
- `.trellis/spec/` — package- and layer-scoped coding guidelines (read before writing code in a given layer)
- `.trellis/workspace/` — per-developer journals and session traces
- `.trellis/tasks/` — active and archived tasks (PRDs, research, jsonl context)

If a Trellis command is available on your platform (e.g. `/trellis:finish-work`, `/trellis:continue`), prefer it over manual steps. Not every platform exposes every command.

If you're using Codex or another agent-capable tool, additional project-scoped helpers may live in:

- `.agents/skills/` — reusable Trellis skills
- `.codex/agents/` — optional custom subagents

Managed by Trellis. Edits outside this block are preserved; edits inside may be overwritten by a future `trellis update`.

## Trellis spec mechanism (mandatory when rotating between models)

- **A work order must embed the original text of two specs**: the nearest `AGENTS.md` for the target package + the relevant `.trellis/spec/` index.
- **Specs must be machine-checkable** (attach the grep command, run it before delivery and again at review time); relying on discipline alone always drifts.
- **Formatting fixes belong to the reviewer-of-record, not the auditor** — letting the auditing role edit code destroys independence.
- **Do not skip Phase 3.3 `trellis-update-spec`** (required): this batch's specs are written back so the next batch inherits them automatically.
- Deep usage (skills list / spec mechanism / migration criteria / review blind spots) → `/home/chris/orca/projects/trellis/shared/rules/trellis-handbook-omp.md`, **do not `@`-preload it**. Three moments where it must be read: ① before entering the planning phase of a new trellis task ② before handing work to another model ③ before closing out a batch.
- **Formal pause (mandatory)**: stopping mid-way through a trellis task **must use `/trellis:paused-work`** (commit + RESUME anchor + no archiving).

## Overview

This directory contains guidelines for backend development. Fill in each file with your project's specific conventions.

## Guidelines Index

| Guide | Description | Status |
|-------|-------------|--------|
| [Directory Structure](./directory-structure.md) | Module organization and file layout | To fill |
| [Database Guidelines](./database-guidelines.md) | ORM patterns, queries, migrations | To fill |
| [Error Handling](./error-handling.md) | Error types, handling strategies | To fill |
| [Quality Guidelines](./quality-guidelines.md) | Code standards, forbidden patterns | To fill |
| [Logging Guidelines](./logging-guidelines.md) | Structured logging, log levels | To fill |
| [Extension Runtime Contracts](./extension-runtime-contracts.md) | Atomic session-bound side requests and prompt-cache keepalive | Active |
| [Patch Rollup Contracts](./patch-rollup-contracts.md) | Pristine generation, family boundaries, replay equivalence, and immutable retirement | Active |
| [Context Plugin Eval](./context-plugin-eval.md) | Sandbox isolation, sentinel contracts, and cache-prefix probes for context-managing plugins | Active |
| [Verification Gate Contracts](./verification-gate-contracts.md) | Falsifiable gates, fault-tree construction, pinned fixtures, and representation sync | Active |

## How to Fill These Guidelines

For each guideline file:

1. Document your project's **actual conventions** (not ideals)
2. Include **code examples** from your codebase
3. List **forbidden patterns** and why
4. Add **common mistakes** your team has made

The goal is to help AI assistants and new team members understand how YOUR project works.

**Language**: All documentation should be written in **English**.
